Algorithm
*Get input 1 from user

* Get input 2 from user

* While function used for check the condition

* First condition is num2 not equal to 2 ,
and gate used the value stored in count

* Or gate is used between num1 and num2 the 
value stored in num1

*The left movement is used in count the value
 stored in num 2

* Print the sum of two numbers
