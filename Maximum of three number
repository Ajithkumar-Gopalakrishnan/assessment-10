Algorithm

* Get first input from user

* Get second input from user

* Get third input from user

* Next use if function to check the condition
, if n1 greater than other two numbers,if the 
condition true it will print n1 is larger

* If the condition is false it moves to elif
 condition it check if n2 greater than other 
two input it will print n2 is largest number

* If the elif condition is false it moves to 
another elif condition it check if n3 greater 
than other two numbers it will print n3 is 
largest number
